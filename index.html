    <h3>One corner. Four killings</h3>
    <p>The southwest corner of Harvard Park, at West 62nd Street and Harvard Boulevard, has been especially deadly. In the last year-and-a-half, four men have been killed there — while sitting in a car, trying to defuse an argument or walking home from the barber shop or the corner store.</p>
